All text will be done internally, using the fonts PixelSpliter and Wellbutrin. Wellbutrin supports lower case 
while PS does not. Please use Wellbutrin for user inputs like room names etc.

Space background from mockups will be the skybox in engine, similar to other menus

Please avoid drastically stretching or scaling assets, please reach out to me or appropriate members of the art team if 
resizing needs to occur.

In lobby menu will use the player character model for each player as you have been doing

I've included a mockup for the keyboard controller options as well, I am using placeholder icons for the buttons and keys, 
if you can replace them with the actual icons that would be great!

Please let me know if anything is missing or confusing


Thank brogrammers!
