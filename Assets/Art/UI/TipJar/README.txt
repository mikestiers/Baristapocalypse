Hey brogrammer, this is Meg. Here's how to put this thing together.

This asset is made of many layers, especially the jar itself, so please refer to the mockup for the final look of this thing.

For now the 2x is going to represent the score multiplier for # of perfect drinks in a row, if we want to make custom numbers
for each that will have to happen later. Papa tired.

popup will only pop on screen as tips roll in, so allow for it in space. tally will be constantly overtop of the jar to the right.

Now onto the jar. jar_top will obviously be on top. All of the liquids will go in between jar_top and jar_back. jar_back will be on
the bottom. Different liquids are for different states of fullness, use accordingly.

-PLEASE READ THIS PART-

This jar will be going IN THE MIDDLE of the order cards like in mockup_HUD, please adjust the locations of the HUD accordingly,
please use this mockup for scaling as well.

That is all. Have fun :)

-Meg
